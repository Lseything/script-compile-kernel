* This is a script made in $bash to assist in preparing the build for the GKI kernel, where it installs important packages and automatically synchronizes the repository.

* To adapt the script to your kernel you need to put the name of your kernel folder in » kernel_folder_name and you will need a custom build.sh where you will put it inside your kernel folder directly, go back to the script outside the kernel folder and put the name of the script in » your_script.sh

* This is a public script and forks are enabled so you can modify it however you want if you understand $bash.
